Photo editing encompasses everything from basic adjustments to creating entirely new images. It's not limited to applying filters but involves a range of technical processes.

## Options

**1. Exposure**
- **Function**: Adjusts the overall brightness or darkness of an image.
- **Impact**: Can make underexposed (too dark) or overexposed (too bright) photos appear more balanced.

**2. Brilliance**
- **Function**: Enhances texture and details in an image, particularly in well-lit areas.
- **Impact**: Makes the image appear more vibrant without altering saturation.

**3. Highlights**
- **Function**: Adjusts the brightest areas of the image.
- **Impact**: Reducing highlights can bring back details in overexposed areas.

**4. Shadows**
- **Function**: Alters the darker areas of the image.
- **Impact**: Lightening shadows can reveal details in underexposed areas.

**5. Contrast**
- **Function**: Changes the difference between the dark and light areas of an image.
- **Impact**: Increasing contrast makes darks darker and lights lighter, adding depth to the image.

**6. Brightness**
- **Function**: Adjusts the overall lightness or darkness.
- **Impact**: Unlike exposure, it uniformly brightens or darkens the entire image.

**7. Black Point**
- **Function**: Sets the point at which the darkest parts of the image appear completely black.
- **Impact**: Adjusting the black point can add depth and intensity to an image.

**8. Saturation**
- **Function**: Increases or decreases the intensity of all colors in an image.
- **Impact**: High saturation can make colors more vivid, while low saturation can make them more muted.

**9. Vibrance**
- **Function**: Similar to saturation, but it affects the less saturated colors more.
- **Impact**: Enhances muted colors without oversaturating already vibrant areas.

**10. Warmth**
- **Function**: Adjusts the color temperature.
- **Impact**: Adds a cooler (blue) or warmer (yellow) tint to the image.

**11. Tint**
- **Function**: Adds a green or magenta hue to the image.
- **Impact**: Useful for color correction and achieving a specific mood.

**12. Sharpness**
- **Function**: Enhances the definition and clarity of edges in the image.
- **Impact**: Makes the image appear more crisp, but over-sharpening can lead to unnatural results.

**13. Grain**
- **Function**: Adds a texture to the image that resembles traditional film grain.
- **Impact**: Can give a photo a more organic or vintage feel.

## Quality Considerations

Editing alters the original data of pixels. While it can enhance an image, it may also reduce quality in terms of the accuracy of pixel representation compared to the original capture. One way around this is to capture and edit RAW image files.

**RAW files** capture pure, uncompressed data straight from the camera sensor, offering a digital file with all the essential details of the photo. They provide significantly more color information compared to JPEGs. RAW files allow for an expanded dynamic range, enabling photographers to extract incredible details from highlights and shadows. They also provide flexibility in adjusting white balance and color information during post-processing.

## File Formats

- **[JPEG](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000017.shtml) (JPG)**: Common, "lossy" compressed format, versatile for web and print.
- **[PNG](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000153.shtml)**: Ideal for web use with transparent backgrounds, "lossless" but low resolution.
- **[TIFF](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000022.shtml)**: High-quality, "lossless" format, suitable for print but not for web use.
- **[RAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format)**: Unprocessed image format, captures all details, used for extensive editing.

## [Bit Depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth)

The differences between **8-bit **and **16-bit** images are significant, impacting the color depth, file size, and editing flexibility of the images.

- **8-bit Images**: These images have a bit depth of 8 bits per color channel, resulting in 256 levels of color and tone per channel. This equates to 16 million colors.
- **16-bit Images**: With a bit depth of 16 bits per color channel, these images offer 65,536 levels of color and tone per channel. This leads to a staggering 28 billion colors in total, providing a lot more latitude for changes.

### Editing and Image Quality

16-bit images offer more room to push and pull colors and tones before seeing artifacts like banding. This makes them ideal for extensive post-processing. Shooting in JPEG limits the image to 8-bit, while RAW images can range from 12 to 16-bit, offering higher quality and more editing flexibility.

Converting an 8-bit image to 16-bit in editing software doesn't increase its quality. The extra bit depth in a 16-bit document only provides 'space' that remains unused if the original image is 8-bit. Higher bit depth means larger file sizes, which can be more demanding in terms of processing and storage.

The choice between 8-bit and 16-bit depends on the desired flexibility in editing and the capabilities of your computer hardware to handle larger files.
