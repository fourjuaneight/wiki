Digital photography refers to the process of capturing images using electronic sensors within digital cameras rather than traditional photographic film.

## Common Types of Digital Cameras

1. **[Digital Single-Lens Reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera) (DSLR)**:
   - **Description**: Utilizes a mirror mechanism to direct light from the lens to an optical viewfinder.
   - **Advantages**: Known for high image quality, robust manual controls, and the ability to change lenses.
   - **Common Usage**: Popular among professionals and serious amateurs for various photography genres.

2. **[Mirrorless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_camera)**:
   - **Description**: Foregoes the mirror mechanism, using electronic viewfinders or LCD screens for image composition.
   - **Advantages**: More compact and lighter than DSLRs, with advancements making them highly capable performers.
   - **Common Usage**: Favored for both professional and personal use, especially where portability is a priority.

3. **[Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-and-shoot_camera)**:
   - **Description**: Often called point-and-shoot cameras, these devices are designed for ease of use.
   - **Advantages**: Lightweight, with many automatic settings for simplicity.
   - **Common Usage**: Suitable for casual photography and travel.

4. **[Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_camera)**:
   - **Description**: Positioned between compact and DSLR cameras, offering a fixed lens with extensive zoom capabilities.
   - **Advantages**: More features than compacts, without the complexity of interchangeable lenses.
   - **Common Usage**: Ideal for users seeking versatility without the bulk of DSLRs.

## Sensor Types

- **[Full Frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-frame_DSLR)**:
  - **Size**: Comparable to the traditional 35mm film.
  - **Features**: Offers superior image quality, excellent low-light performance, and shallow depth of field effects.
  - **Typical Use**: Found in professional-grade cameras, favored for high-quality images in various lighting conditions.

- **[APS-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS-C)**:
  - **Size**: Smaller than full frame, common in many consumer and mid-range cameras.
  - **Features**: Provides a good balance of quality, portability, and price.
  - **Typical Use**: Widely used in entry to mid-level DSLRs and mirrorless systems.

- **[Micro Four Thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system)**:
  - **Size**: Smaller still, used in a specific segment of mirrorless cameras.
  - **Features**: Offers a compact system with adequate quality and versatility.
  - **Typical Use**: Popular for travelers and those needing a compact yet capable camera.


## Lenses

- **[Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_lens)**:
  - **Description**: Fixed focal length with typically wider apertures.
  - **Advantages**: High-quality optics offering superior sharpness and low-light performance.

- **[Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_lens)**:
  - **Description**: Include variable focal lengths, providing flexibility.
  - **Advantages**: Ideal for dynamic environments where adjusting framing quickly is beneficial.

- **[Wide-Angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-angle_lens)**:
  - **Description**: Capture expansive views, emphasizing spatial depth.
  - **Usage**: Ideal for landscapes and architectural photography.

- **[Telephoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephoto_lens)**:
  - **Description**: Allows for photographing distant subjects with magnification.
  - **Usage**: Common in wildlife and sports photography for close-ups.

## File Formats

- **[JPEG](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000017.shtml) (JPG)**: Common, "lossy" compressed format, versatile for web and print.
- **[TIFF](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000022.shtml)**: High-quality, "lossless" format, suitable for print but not for web use.
- **[RAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format)**: Unprocessed image format, captures all details, used for extensive editing.
