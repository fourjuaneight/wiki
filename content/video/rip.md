Ripping is the process of copying audio or video content from a physical medium like a CD, DVD, Blu-Ray, or streaming media, onto a computer's hard drive. It's a legitimate way to create a digital copy of media you own, although the legality can vary by jurisdiction and the type of media being ripped.

Ripping software typically includes an encoder to compress the source media, reducing the file size for storage. Some rippers also feature a converter program to change the media's file format. For instance, if you're ripping a DVD, you might choose to save the video in MP4 or MKV format, which are more versatile and widely supported than DVD's native VOB format.

If you're ripping for backup, ISO format retains all data but results in a large file. For general viewing, MP4 or MKV are better choices. In the U.S., it's generally legal to rip audio media you own for personal use, but video is a gray area. Always refer to local laws before ripping, especially commercial DVDs.

After ripping and converting, you can also "burn" the files back onto a recordable CD or DVD if needed.
