# CDs

CDs are a digital storage medium that uses a thin, circular disc to store data such as music, photos, or files. The disc is made of a shiny, reflective material, usually polycarbonate plastic (about 1.2 mm thick), coated with a thin layer of aluminum. An acrylic layer is then sprayed over the aluminum to protect it, and the label is printed onto the acrylic.

Here's how it works:

1. **Data Encoding**: Information is stored on the CD as a series of tiny bumps and flat areas called "pits" and "lands". These microscopic bumps are impressed onto the plastic, forming a single, continuous, extremely long spiral track of data. These represent the binary code of 0s and 1s that computers understand.

2. **Reading the CD**: A CD drive uses a laser to read the CD. The laser shines on the disc, and the way the light reflects off the pits and lands is detected by a sensor. This reflection is translated into the binary code, which is then converted into the music you hear or the files you see.

3. **Writing to a CD**: In writable CDs, the reflective layer can be altered by a more powerful laser. This laser can change the reflective properties of specific areas, creating a pattern of pits and lands that corresponds to the data being stored.

4. **Error Correction**: CDs include error correction technology to ensure that small scratches or dust don't interfere with playback. This helps in maintaining the quality of the data.

## Audio Quality

CD audio quality is renowned for its clarity and fidelity, largely due to key technical aspects. The **sampling rate of 44.1 kHz** ensures that all audible frequencies are captured, creating a true-to-life sound reproduction. A **16-bit depth** allows for 65,536 different levels of amplitude in each sample, contributing to a detailed representation of the sound wave and a wide dynamic range. This dynamic range enables CDs to reproduce both very quiet and very loud sounds without distortion, providing a rich audio experience. Additionally, unlike some digital formats, CD audio is **uncompressed**, meaning that no information is lost, preserving the full quality of the original recording. These factors collectively contribute to the high regard for CD audio quality in the music industry.

## Longevity

CDs were once thought to be nearly indestructible, but research has shown that they can be susceptible to a phenomenon known as "disc rot". **Disc rot manifests as discolorations, tiny pin pricks, or even a change in color on the surface of the CD.** The underlying cause is often attributed to improper dyes or inferior lacquer that reduces the quality of the discs. In some cases, materials meant to protect the disc, such as sulfur in attached books and CD inlays, can actually damage it.

[The Library of Congress has noted that proper storage and handling can extend the life of a well-made pressed compact disc for many decades](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/scientists/projects/cd_longevity.html). However, discs stored in harsh environmental conditions with elevated temperature or humidity will have shorter expected lifetimes. Disc rot is a significant concern for both archivists and collectors, as it leads to the loss of data that cannot be repaired, potentially rendering great albums or interesting movies unplayable.

## Storage

Storing CDs properly requires careful consideration of the environment, placement, and handling. CDs should be stored in an area with stably low temperatures (55-70 degrees Fahrenheit) and low humidity (30-55%), away from flooding, air pollutants, and sunlight. Basements can be suitable if humidity levels are regulated, but attics or garages with unregulated climates should be avoided. In terms of placement, CDs should be stored vertically in their plastic cases, away from sunlight or UV light, and not on the floor to prevent exposure to water damage or pests. Handling CDs with care is also essential; adhesive labels or solvent-based permanent markers should not be used on the discs, and special markers made for archiving optical discs should be utilized if labeling is necessary. Following these guidelines helps preserve the quality and longevity of CDs.
