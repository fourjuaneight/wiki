When setting up the visual aspects of a home theater system, the hardware and viewing position are key elements that can make or break your cinematic experience. The television or display should face the seating area from the center speaker position. The distance between the screen and the seats should be calculated carefully to maximize the benefits of HD and widescreen resolution. 

## Viewing Distances

- **32-inch TV**: 32 to 48 inches
- **43-inch TV**: 43 to 64.5 inches
- **49-inch TV**: 49 to 73.5 inches
- **50-inch TV**: 50 to 75 inches
- **55-inch TV**: 55 to 82.5 inches
- **65-inch TV**: 65 to 97.5 inches
- **75-inch TV**: 75 to 112.5 inches
- **77-inch TV**: 77 to 115.5 inches
- **85-inch TV**: 85 to 127.5 inches

### Impact on Viewing Experience

The distance at which you sit from your TV can significantly impact your viewing experience. For 4K UHD TVs, the ideal viewing distance is between **1 to 1-1/2 times the screen size** to get the most detailed picture. Sitting too close to older TVs would reveal scan lines or pixelation, but with the high resolution of 4K UHD TVs, this is less of an issue. The real concern is sitting too far away and missing out on the details and picture quality you paid for.

The recommended distances offer a range to accommodate personal preferences. Even if you sit farther away than the recommended distances, a 4K TV with High Dynamic Range (HDR) will still look sharp and offer improved contrast and color ranges. Therefore, choosing the right size and distance can make a world of difference in your home theater setup.

## Audio Configurations

When it comes to home theater audio, the term "surround sound" is often thrown around. But essentially, surround sound uses multiple audio channels and an array of speakers to create a more realistic and immersive audio experience than a typical 2-channel stereo setup. The configurations are usually denoted by numbers like 5.1, 7.1, or 9.1, where the first number indicates the number of full-range loudspeakers, and the second number specifies the number of low-frequency subwoofer channels. Sometimes, you'll even see a third number, which refers to aerial (height) speakers, especially useful for Dolby Atmos technology.

## 5.1 Configuration: The Standard
The 5.1 configuration is the most popular and consists of six channels: three front channels, two rear (surround) channels, and one subwoofer channel. It's the standard for DVD and Blu-ray media, supported by Dolby Digital and Dolby DTS.

## 7.1 and 9.1 Configurations: The Advanced
For those looking to up the ante, 7.1 and 9.1 configurations offer more channels and, therefore, a more immersive experience. These setups are particularly beneficial for larger rooms or for those who want to take full advantage of high-definition audio formats.

## AV Receivers: The Heart of the System
An Audio-Visual (AV) receiver is essential for a surround sound setup. It receives, processes, and amplifies audio and visual signals to drive the speakers and display. Make sure your AV receiver is compatible with the audio decoders used by your media sources, such as Dolby Digital or Dolby Digital Plus.

## Cables and Connections: The Nitty-Gritty
Your AV receiver will have various inputs and outputs, including HDMI, digital coaxial and optical inputs, multi-channel analog connections, and speaker terminals. HDMI is crucial for modern setups, especially those involving HD and 4K sources. Coaxial and optical inputs are used for transmitting digital audio signals, while multi-channel analog connections are used for connecting DVD or Blu-ray players to your AV receiver.

## Room Optimization: The Final Touch
The room's acoustics play a significant role in the audio experience. A mix of hard and soft surfaces is ideal for sound reflection and absorption. Acoustic panels and bass traps can further optimize the sound.

So, is setting up a surround sound system worth the effort? Absolutely. The immersive experience it offers is unparalleled, making every movie night a cinematic event.
